## The wine app build for wine professionals, who need a modern note taking method.

I build this app to cater to a very specific group of people, the wine professionals, because I was once a part of that group. I often found myself taking photos of wine lables, but not having any notes with the wine 'bottle shot'. Or I would find piles of wine tasting notes given to me by a wine seller that I would star or write a few simple notes by, but without having comperhensive notes, would be meaningless after some time. So, I built the app with these goals:

* Have a digital place to store thorough wine notes
* Be able to save those wine notes
in order to refer back to them at a later date.
* ..(not currently implemented) be able to take a photo of the wine to keep with the wine notes.

## Deliverable 

If you have the Ionic View app, you can give my app a test run. Use the following code when propted to connect to my app:

### Known issues

*The log in error handling need to be changed. Currently in the ion view app, if a log in does not fufill the proper requirements (6 characters & email contains @ symbol and a . ) then the app will freeze. I think the best why to fix this is move the error event into an ActionSheet or a modal.

*The camera intergation is half built at the moment. A user can currently take a photo, but I does not persist on to the save wine page. This functionality should be pretty straightforward. I just need a little time to build and test.
